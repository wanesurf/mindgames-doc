### 2) Choose a Game

There's  3 games you can choose from:\
\
**A) Asteroid**&#x20;

You're the captain of your own spaceship! Avoid the asteroid and go as far as possible towards your destiny! \
Players play in an asynchronous manner to determine who did the best

\
**B) Ultimatum**&#x20;

In the role game, one of the 2 players is the Dictator, choosing how much will you receive from the tokens that has been put in escrow. \
If you cannot find a common ground on how to split the tokens, it all goes back to the treasury!

### 3) Play for $COREUM, for $MIND or for FREE&#x20;

You will need to select one of the available game modes in order to start. Here's some information:

* For $COREUM — the $COREUM token will be used as a bet. The minimal bet is 10 $COREUM.
* For $MIND — MIND will be used as a bet. The minimal bet is 1 MIND.
* Free game — this mode doesn't include any gain or loss.&#x20;

If you choose to play for tokens, you would need to deposit either $COREUM or $MIND in escrow,&#x20;

### 2) Game play&#x20;

For all games we use a commit/ reveal schame. Each round is sent to the Coreum blockchain for transparency and verification!
