# Wallet

Trade safely, Play efficiently

Protected by Telegram's strong encryption and security features to keep your assets and transactions secure\
We create a Smart Wallet with fee abstraction so that you can play for free without even holding the $COREUM

On the first opening of the application, we will create a Coreum Wallet for you and give you the opportunity to export the private key.
